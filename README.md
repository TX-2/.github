The TX-2 project aims to re-create the historic [TX-2
computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TX-2), in emulation, to allow
some historically important
[software](https://tx-2.github.io/software/), for example [Ivan
Sutherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Sutherland)'s
[Sketchpad](https://github.com/TX-2/Sketchpad), to run again.
